Test-HTTP-Reflector

You are doing another integration project, but the other end isn't available.
How can you test the integration with their API?

How do you test your code from bottom to top to make sure its integration works
as desired?

Simulator pattern to the rescue.  Usually, you write a small program that stands
in for the unavailable integration partner and responds exactly how that partner
is expected to respond.

This module helps you create that program - and provides one called httpreflector.
